Funkshun
========

A small and simple library which gives a solution on how to deal with functional and technical exception handling. This is done by 
defining a standard way of returning method calls. This behaviour is enforced by a special bread of methods called funkshuns, which
mandates this and extense the possibilities with it. Read further if you want to know more... 

Goals
-----

In every project the question arises on how to deal with technical and functional exceptions. A solution could be to throw exceptions, 
provide output parameters or even worse return strings. I've seen a lot different implementations or even combinations of those and they
all didn't really do it for me. I believe that on every project there should be a convention on how to deal with exceptions be
it function or technical. On most projects I have been on, this wasn't the case or it was implemented in different ways by different 
developers.

With this in mind the goals of this project are:

1. Provide a simple convention for handling functional/technical messages.
2. Provide helper methods which utilizes this convention.
